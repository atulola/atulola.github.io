<h1>Mercury – The Swift Planet</h1>

<p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in our Solar System. It orbits at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers. Because of this proximity, Mercury completes one revolution around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making it the fastest planet.</p>

<p>Its surface is rocky and heavily cratered, similar to Earth’s Moon. Large impact basins such as Caloris Basin reveal a violent past filled with asteroid collisions. Mercury’s diameter is about 4,880 kilometers.</p>

<p>Temperatures vary extremely. Daytime temperatures can reach 430°C, while nighttime temperatures drop to -180°C. These drastic changes occur because Mercury lacks a thick atmosphere to trap heat.</p>

<p>Mercury rotates three times for every two orbits around the Sun. This unique 3:2 spin-orbit resonance makes one Mercury day last 176 Earth days.</p>

<p>The planet has a very large iron core, making up most of its interior. This core generates a weak magnetic field. Scientists believe Mercury may have once been larger but lost much of its outer layer after a massive collision.</p>

<p>It has no moons and no rings. Despite being closest to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet—Venus holds that title due to its thick greenhouse atmosphere.</p>

<p>Space missions like Mariner 10 and MESSENGER provided detailed images and data about Mercury’s surface and composition.</p>

<p>Mercury helps scientists understand early Solar System formation and extreme planetary environments.</p>
