<p>
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in our solar system...
It completes one orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Despite being so close
to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet—Venus holds that title due to its
greenhouse effect. Mercury has almost no atmosphere, which means temperatures
fluctuate dramatically between extreme heat and extreme cold.
<br><br>
The surface of Mercury resembles Earth’s Moon and is covered in craters caused by
asteroid impacts. Because it lacks a thick atmosphere, meteoroids frequently strike
its surface. Mercury rotates very slowly compared to Earth. One Mercury day
(sunrise to sunrise) lasts about 176 Earth days.
<br><br>
NASA missions such as Mariner 10 and MESSENGER have provided detailed images and
scientific data. Mercury has a large iron core, making up most of its mass, which
creates a weak magnetic field. Scientists believe Mercury formed billions of years
ago when the solar system was young.
